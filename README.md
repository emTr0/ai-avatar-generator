# Stable Diffusion AI Generator Project

Based on a [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project where I learned about Stable Diffusion to create a web app where users can generate avatars with my likeness.

Web app available at [ai-avatar-generator-production.up.railway.app](https://ai-avatar-generator-production.up.railway.app/).

Try something like "emTr0 as Thor in Avengers"! Want to have more control over how the AI generates images? Check out this awesome guide on [becoming a prompt engineer](https://buildspace.so/p/build-ai-avatars/lessons/become-a-prompt-engineer).

There may be a slight delay in the avatar's generation depending on how many requests the services are getting, and when my model was last used.
